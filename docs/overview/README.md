## fundamentals
The language is designed to be easy to use and to understand.
In this section we will talk about how it works and how to write it out.
### 1. Syntax
The syntax is very simple. A command is a liner of text with a newline at the end.
If there is no newline, the interpiter will read it as one command. Variables must start with a letter either up or lower case
and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. Commands starts with dots followed by the command with any inputs after that with
a space inbeween the commands and separate inputs.
> Example of good variable names:
> * var1
> * VarTwo
> * var_Three
> * goodVarFour
> * var_5

> Example of bad variable names:
> * 123
> * var-2
> * Var#3
> * Var\+#$4
